## Reflection on AI Use in Development

### ðŸ”¹ How AI Was Used

* Brainstormed project ideas aligned with help desk technician career goals.
* Generated initial drafts of troubleshooting steps and preventive measures.
* Helped structure Markdown formatting, tables, and flow.

---

### ðŸ”¹ What Worked Well

* AI accelerated **content drafting** and ensured coverage of common IT issues.
* Provided **professional formatting** suggestions (tables, TOC, README structure).
* Saved significant time in structuring and polishing documentation.

---

### ðŸ”¹ What Didnâ€™t Work

* Some AI-generated instructions needed **accuracy checks** (e.g., OS-specific commands).
* Business value explanations required refinement to align with real-world employer needs.
* Diagrams and flowcharts were useful but sometimes too detailed for a 1-day scope.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Lessons Learned

* AI is excellent for **drafting and formatting**, but **manual review** is critical for accuracy.
* Clear prompts and iteration lead to better AI outputs.
* Expanding content manually after AI drafts ensures depth and realism.
* Combining AI with human editing creates professional, portfolio-ready documentation.

**Final Note:** This project demonstrates how AI-assisted development can create polished, high-value IT documentation in a short timeframe.
